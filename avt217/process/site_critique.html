	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>After a quick animation which shows the bands logo in the middle of the screen the website becomes the image above. The website is layed out cleanly with a simple menu button in the top right corner that expands to show multiple different pages to choose from. In the bottom right there are link to social media pages. Text on the bottom left invites the user to scroll down which reveals new single releases and live tour dates. The latest album artwork in the center is not clickable and merely serves as a nice image to look at.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The website is very easy to use and has nice simple animations that add a touch of playfulness.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The large album artwork takes center stage in the hierarchy, leaving the logo and menu button to be the second place a viewer would look. Website navigation and description text remain consistent and are layed out nicely while songs have a playful font next to the artwork of the song and a different font detailing whether they are new releases the date they released.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>I am a big fan of the overall look and feel of this website. My favorite is easily the giant album artwork as soon as you enter the website with a nice blurred effect around it. Overall website feels exactly what I'd expect from this band, a clean simple layout with some playful touches that add the expression of music to the experience.</p>

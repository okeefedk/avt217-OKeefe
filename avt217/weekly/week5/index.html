    <h2>Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast</h2>

    <p>In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, Carl Dair showed how in typography, as in music, harmony and contrast are the keys to composition.</p>

    <p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe -- and show -- the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>
	 
	<p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say "typographer": someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter, but someone who uses type, in all its variations, as the principle element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of typography requires a designer who cares about the words themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and is skillful enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve as simply eye-catching decoration.</p>
	  
	<p>Carl Dair's book "Design With Type" (originally published in 1952; revised and expanded in 1967) is deservedly still in print, even though the technology that he used and described has long been outdated. The practicalities of setting type in metal are no longer the practicalities we have to deal with; but the visual relationships between letters, which Dair showed and explained so graphically in his book, haven't changed at all. "Design With Type" is still one of the best handbooks available for learning how to do exactly what the title says: design with type.</p>
	  
	<p>At around the same time he was revising his book, Carl Dair was producing a series of six pamphlets for West Virginia Pulp and Paper (Westvaco), which he called "A Typographic Quest." Each booklet was, naturally, printed on Westvaco paper stock; like the lavish paper-company samples produced today, this series was meant to raise the profile of the manufacturer and encourage designers to think of Westvaco when specifying paper for their printing jobs. But these were quite modest productions: little saddlestitched booklets of about 30 pages, measuring 5-1/4 inches by 9, usually printed in two colors (the first one uses three colors throughout; the later ones are two-color, although the second color may change from sheet to sheet, with all three colors used together on the covers). The first "A Typographic Quest" was published in 1964; the sixth (and, as far as I know, final) came out in 1968, the year Carl Dair died. Since he was both writer and designer for the series, each of the booklets emerged as a wholly crafted object, dedicated to explaining one or another aspect of using type.</p>
	  
	<h2>Harmony and Contrast</h2> 
	  
	<p>The heart of Carl Dair's teaching -- the thing that I keep pointing people to, and the most valuable thing I myself learned from his work -- is the subject of "A Typographic Quest" No. 5: "Typographic Contrast." In a virtuoso performance, Dair shows exactly how designers use different kinds of visual contrast to make design work and meaning pop out -- clearly and unambiguously, and with flair. To make his point, he compares typography to music.</p>
	  
	<p>Graphic form and musical form have a common denominator: rhythm and emphasis, harmony and contrast. "Harmony and contrast," says Dair, "are fundamental to both, and the discovery of these basic principles and their application to the design of printed matter is the object of this volume of 'A Typographic Quest.'"</p>

    <h2>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Contrast of Size</li>
      <li>Contrast of Weight</li>
      <li>Contrast of Form</li>
      <li>Contrast of Structure</li>
      <li>Contrast of Texture</li>
      <li>Contrast of Color</li>
      <li>Contrast of Direction</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="contrast-section">
      <h3>Contrast of Size</h3>
      <p>A simple but dramatic contrast of size provides a point to which the reader's attention is drawn. It is only a physical enlargement of the basic pattern created by the form and the weight of the type being used for the text.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="contrast-section">
      <h3>Contrast of Weight</h3>
      <p>Bold type stands out in the middle of lighter type of the same style. Other typographic material such as rules, spots, or shapes can emphasize heavy areas for visual attraction or emphasis.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="contrast-section">
      <h3>Contrast of Form</h3>
      <p>This refers to the distinction between capital and lowercase letters, roman and italic variants, or condensed and expanded forms. These changes create expressive differences in tone.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="contrast-section">
      <h3>Contrast of Structure</h3>
      <p>The difference between typefaces themselves — for example, a sans serif vs. a serif, or an italic vs. a blackletter — creates structure contrast, much like an orator changing the quality of their voice.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="contrast-section">
      <h3>Contrast of Texture</h3>
      <p>Texture is the overall appearance of text on the page — the “fabric” of type. It emerges from letterforms, spacing, and layout, shaping the reading rhythm.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="contrast-section">
      <h3>Contrast of Color</h3>
      <p>Color contrast requires careful use of tonal value and hue. Black on white is typically strongest; other colors must be balanced to ensure readability and emphasis.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="contrast-section">
      <h3>Contrast of Direction</h3>
      <p>Vertical vs. horizontal orientation, or angled layouts, can create dynamic movement. Even within blocks of text, changes in line length and column shape can express direction.</p>
